# Stroke Risk Prediction using Machine Learning 
This project aims to predict the risk of stroke health related features. The implementation is built using PySpark to handle prepocessing and model training. Multiple algorithm were explored and evaluated to identify the best performing model. The final model selection was made through comparatitve analysis and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.
