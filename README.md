# Stroke-Classification-Using-PySpark
This project aims to build a stroke classification model using PySpark. The process begins with correlation analysis using Pearson method and continued with class balancing using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Several algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron are used to train the model. The model evaluation results aim to improve the accuracy of stroke risk prediction.
